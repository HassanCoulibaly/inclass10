Signup Page - Flutter Form Validation Demo
Overview
This is a Flutter application developed as part of In Class Activity 10: Flutter Form Input Validation - Building a Signup Page. The project creates a signup page with form fields for user input, including date of birth (with a date picker), email, first name, last name, phone number, and age. It implements form validation and provides feedback upon submission. This is a collaborative effort between Venkata Saileenath Reddy Jamapala and Hassan Coulibaly.

Due Date: March 24, 2025, 8:30 PM

Notes
The project meets the core requirements of the activity: form creation, input validation, and UI design.
Navigation to a confirmation screen is not implemented in this version but can be added by extending the ElevatedButtonâ€™s onPressed logic with Navigator.push.
The date picker fulfills the "explore the calendar widget" hint from the activity.
Troubleshooting
Dependencies Fail: Run flutter clean followed by flutter pub get.
SDK Version Issues: Ensure your Flutter SDK is 2.12.0 or higher (flutter --version to check; flutter upgrade to update if needed).
Form Not Scrolling: The ListView ensures scrollability; test on smaller screens to confirm.
Future Improvements
Add navigation to a confirmation page after submission.
Enhance validation (e.g., email format, phone number regex).
Style the UI with custom themes or colors.
